# Elevator Controller Design

## Introduction
The task: Create a controller algorithm which directs visitors of a 100-story office building to elevators based upon a person's current floor and target floor. In thinking about this problem, I quickly came to realize that the job would best be accomplished with an Object Oriented approach. The solution presented describes the classes below. Note that the code is currently for illustrative purposes and does not yet compile.

## Elevator
#### Attributes
* Bank: Integer
* Going Up: Boolean
* Going Down: Boolean
* Serving Floor: Floor object
* Assigned Floors: [] (Sorted, contains next location. If array is empty, itâ€™s idle)
- Note: No more than 10 stops in queue at a time for service quality

## Floor
#### Attributes
* Number: Integer

## Controller
#### Attributes
* Target Floor
* Current Floor
* Best Elevator

## Relationships
* Elevator has_many Floors
* Controller belongs_to Floor

Seeing that the problem's conditionals were quickly becoming complex and not easily scalable, after a search, I realized that State Design Pattern would be more intuitive to scale. Below is a preliminary diagram of how the program could be restructured.
